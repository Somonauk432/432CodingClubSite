#Coding Club Site
## Welcome...
Well, the goal of this entire thing is to give us a group project, while at the same time let us show off and have some fun.

TODO:
+ Come up with content!
+ Code in the HTML
+ Plan specialized pages
+ Try out different css options
+ Think about extended functionality/eye candy with javaScript/jQuery

If you have any ideas/code/problems you can contact me at wimberc@somonauk.net or you can message me on GitHub (TungstenNo74)
